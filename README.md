# IT-270-Secure-ChatApp-Project

This is a group project(3 students). It is a Secure Chat Application that facilitates users to exchange text messages securely. It implements various cryptographic techniques for secure communication between sender and receiver.

Users can securely chat by using symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods. 
The symmetric techniques require the sender and receiver to share a secret key for encryption and decryption. 
As for asymmetric techniques, the sender uses their private key for encryption, while the receiver uses the sender's public key for decryption.

Implemented Techniques
The application features the following encryption techniques:
1.	Caesar cipher
2.	Monoalphabetic
3.	Polyalphabetic
4.	Hill cipher
5.	Playfair
6.	OTP
7.	Rail fence
8.	Columnar
9.	DES
10.	AES
11.	RC4
12.	RSA
13.	ECC
14.	DH for key exchange
15.	Hashing (SHA) for integrity checking

Bonus Functionality
Additionally, the application includes a bonus feature that enables users to encrypt and decrypt images, 
providing an enhanced layer of security for multimedia file exchanges.

# How to use

Clone the repo to your local system and make sure the last three files named, chatapp.py, server.py and client.py are in the same folder and 
you can simple run it in any python IDEs. Simpley open 'chatapp.py' and run it.
